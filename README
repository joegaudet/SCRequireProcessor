SCRequireProcessor:

Refactoring Sproutcore folders and files is a major pain, since the sc_require calls don't get automatically updated.

I wrote this Java class (It's jared as well), to help rectify this problem.

It basically walks your SC app folder looking for declarations like the following

MyApp.<something> = <SomethingElse>.extend({});

It then performs a second pass looking for uses of any kind and prepends the appropriate sc_requires.

It also lops off the licence description (provided you are using the default one) and inserts your custom one.

Right now the replacement one is hard coded, so you'll have to change that and jar this up your self (or simply run it with Java). If there is
sufficient interest I will extend it to allow you to specify the licence to be inserted in a file.

Let me know how you like it

UPDATE:

If you have a require that isn't based on standard SC usage, you may now annotate it, and it will be ignored by the processor

/* @ignore */ sc_require('manage/me/manually');
